# Three.js-Showcase

Showcase that uses an [ObjectLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/loaders/ObjectLoader) to give the user a visual, Three-Dimensional, perspective of an item.

## If you are contributing:
1. Clone this repo
2. CD into the directory and run `npm i`

To run the development environment: `npm run dev`<br>
To build the solution: `npm run build`

## If you are just looking at the code:
1. Clone this repo
2. All the code can be found in `./build`
3. You must use a server to host the code, either on localhost or however you want to, to avoid CORS policies conflicting. This is a stupid browser restriction that is a pain to get around. Just make sure you host the code on something like xampp or live server extension for VSC.

**Note:** Contents of `./src` will not run in the browser, without a NodeJS environment. Refer to `./build` instead.
